The positive coefficients on these covariates means that increasing GPA, GRE, and prestige rank (higher meaning going from prestige 4 toward prestige 1 in this case) is positively related to chances of admittance to graduate school. In addition, the odds ratios that we calculated for school prestige indicate that students who go to better schools tend to have higher admittance rates, ceteris paribus (keeping all else the same)."

    "Answer: We could extend this analysis by testing it on an out-of-sample data set. Cross-validation could be utilized to perform this testing with less data than might otherwise be necessary. We could also look to add other potential variables in order to increase the model's accuracy. In doing so though, we run the risk of increasing complexity to the point of over-fitting, introducing variance to the model. As the model incorporates new variables, we must \"penalize\" this increase in complexity through regularizing the new regression equation. Some potential additional predictors that could be included are which type of graduate school program the applicant is applying to, the prevalence of any family members that attended the school, as well as extracurricular activities the applicant was involved with."
